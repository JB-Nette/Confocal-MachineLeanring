Usage:
1. Navigate to a directory containing confocal_file_rename.py
2. Run the script with "python confocal_file_rename.py"
3. First window will show up to select the directory containing IMS files.
4. Second window will show up to select the Davil script for the confocal imaging
4. Script will first remove all spaces in file name and rename all the files in the first imaging cycle to from 
(name)_F(ii).ims/(name).xml/(name)_metadata.txt to (name)_0_F(ii).ims/(name)_0.xml/(name)_0_metadata.txt in the selected directory.
5. A new folder "Renamed" will be created.
Based on the Davil script, it will detect the corresponding bleaching cycle ("Flow 55percent Buffer" in the Davil script) and rename the files from
(name)_1_F(ii).ims/(name)_1.xml/(name)_1_metadata.txt to (name)_1_bleached_F(ii).ims/(name)_1_bleached.xml/(name)_1_bleached_metadata.txt. 
All these renamed files are copied into "Renamed". 
Those names unchanged will be copied into "Renamed" as well.
File names in the original directory remained unchanged.
.bat files and files with "FusionStitcher" will be ignored.

Usage:
1. Navigate to a directory containing ims_to_tif.py
2. Run the script with "python ims_to_tif.py <downsample_level>". 
3. A window will show up to select the directory containing IMS files. Converted files will be saved in the selected directory.
4. The downsample level must be a factor of two, and divide evenly into the dimensions of your image.
Use 1 for your downsample ratio if you want a straight conversion. Otherwise, the dimensionality of your image will be divided by the supplied downsample level in the output.
